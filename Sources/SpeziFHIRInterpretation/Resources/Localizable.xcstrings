Line: A 1-5 Word summary of the FHIR resource that immediately identifies the resource and provides the essential information at a glance. Do NOT use a complete sentence; instead, use a formatting typically used for titles in computer systems.\n\n2. Line: Provide a short one-sentence summary of the resource in less than 40 words. Ensure that the summary only focuses on the essential information that a patient would need and, e.g., excludes the person who prescribed a medication or similar metadata. Ensure that all clinically relevant data is included, which allows us to use the summary in additional prompts where using the complete JSON might not be feasible.\n\nThe following JSON representation defines the FHIR resource that you should provide a title and summary for:\n\n{{FHIR_RESOURCE}}"
